## General info
ðŸ’­ Architectural walkthrough: <br/> 
<strong><b>Front-end</b></strong>: The front end of the project is a web application that allows users to view information about upcoming rocket launches and browse through details about past launches and the planets that have been explored. The web application is built using ReactJS and responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience on devices of all sizes. <br/><br/>
<strong><b>Back-end</b></strong>: On the backend, the project is a server-side application that powers the API endpoints consumed by the front-end. It is built using NodeJS and utilizes a database to store information about the rocket launches and the planets that have been explored. The backend also handles tasks such as authentication and authorization for user accounts and any data processing or analysis required for the front-end to function correctly.
